An autonomous robot using arduino uno,L293D motor driver and light detecting resistance able to move in direction of higher light intensity .
Light Detector Resistance - An LDR is a component that has a (variable) resistance that changes with the light intensity that falls upon it.
By comparing intensity of 3 LDR situated at left, middle and right our robot can move in the direction of higher intensity.
